# MonteCarloPiEstimation
This is a very simple project that uses the pygame library to visualize the 'Monte Carlo' method of estimating Pi.

### The math
This project uses the method of randomly placing dots into a square with the side lengths of r*2 and using the Pythagorean theorem to check if the points are inside of the circle with the radius of r. The amount of points in the circle over the total points approximately equals pi*4.

### Run on your computer
1. Install python
2. Use pip to install pygame
3. Download main.py and run it with 'python main.py' while in the same directory.
